# THM-PYRAT Bruteforcing Tool

This tool is designed to interact with a custom Python-based socket server (as seen in the TryHackMe *Pyrat* room) that requires sending the username (`admin`) **before** each set of password attempts.

It handles timeouts, input delays, and reconnections, making it useful for brute-forcing services that deviate from standard authentication flows.
